# Structure of Graphical Interface Variables

The structure of graphical interface variables `RemoteXY` refers to a set of variables in the source code that represent the elements of the graphical interface, such as buttons, sliders, labels, etc. The `RemoteXY` variable structure is automatically generated by the graphical interface editor along with the source code. The structure's fields exactly correspond to the interface elements and contain all variables related to the graphical user interface controls. The variable names are assigned in the graphical interface editor for each control element. For some interface elements, the type of variable can be specified, while for others, the type of the variable is implicitly determined by the element. These names and types are transferred into the fields of the `RemoteXY` structure.

```
struct {

    // input variables
  uint8_t switch_01; 

    // output variables
  float value_01;

    // other variable
  uint8_t connect_flag;  

} RemoteXY;   
```

The `RemoteXY` structure provides variables in a specific order. Input variables come first, followed by output variables. This order must be maintained for proper data exchange with the mobile application. Do not change the order of fields in the `RemoteXY` structure, as it will lead to the malfunctioning of the graphical interface.

#### Where is the GUI data actually stored?

The **RemoteXY** remote control system does not use any servers to store the state of your graphical interface. This means that your data is not sent anywhere else. It is transmitted only between the controller and the mobile application.

The current state of the graphical interface elements is entirely stored in the `RemoteXY` structure in the controller's memory. Each field of this structure holds the state of one of the interface elements, its position, value, or other data. 

When the mobile application connects to the controller, it first reads the data from the `RemoteXY` structure. Then, the mobile app displays the graphical interface in the state in which the data was stored in the structure fields. When the user interacts with the graphical interface, the new data will be saved back into the structure fields. When the graphical interface is closed, the data about its state remains in the controller within the structure. If the controller is then connected to another phone, the mobile application on the new phone will also read the data from the `RemoteXY` structure and display the graphical interface exactly as it was before.

#### Data Transmission Direction

All variables in the structure are divided into input and output. This division depends on the type of control element the variable is associated with. If a control element only displays data transmitted from the controller, the variable associated with it will have the **output** direction. If a control element can interact with the user and the user can change its state, then data from the graphical interface will be transmitted to the controller, and the variable associated with it will have the **input** direction. However, **input** variables can also be transmitted in the reverse direction.

- **Input** - data is primarily transmitted from the graphical interface to the controller, but can also be transmitted in the reverse direction;
- **Output** - data is always transmitted from the controller to the graphical interface.

#### Initial State of Control Elements

When the controller starts, is reset, or experiences an unexpected reboot, all variables in the `RemoteXY` structure are set to their initial state. All variables are assigned a value of 0. When you open the graphical interface after the controller reset, all control elements will also be in their initial state.

If you need to set an initial value for a control element, you can assign this value to the corresponding field in the `RemoteXY` structure. This should be done in the `Setup()` function.

#### What Happens When the Controller is Reset

A random or intentional reset of the controller also results in the loss of data in the fields of the `RemoteXY` structure. If you want to preserve the state of certain control elements, you must ensure the restoration of data in the corresponding structure fields. This needs to be handled manually, for example, by saving the data to non-volatile memory.
