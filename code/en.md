# Source Code

The source code for the microcontroller offers many possibilities for interacting with the graphical interface elements. Interaction occurs through variables associated with control elements. All associated variables in the code are grouped into a structure named `RemoteXY`.

This section describes the general principles of interacting with the graphical interface from the code. For more detailed information on each individual control element, refer to the corresponding section of the documentation.
